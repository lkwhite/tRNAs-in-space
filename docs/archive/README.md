# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical planning documents and development notes from the tRNAs-in-space project. These files are preserved for reference but are no longer actively maintained.

## Directory Structure

### `planning/`
Contains planning documents and recommendations from earlier development phases:

- **RECOMMENDATIONS.md** - Original comprehensive recommendations for repository improvements (2025-11-08)
- **REMAINING_PLAN.md** - Revised recommendations focusing on appropriate scope for the project
- **NEXT_SESSION_START.md** - Session startup guide for Modomics Phase 2 development

These documents were used to guide development but the work described has been completed or superseded.

### `completed-prs/`
Contains summaries and descriptions from completed pull requests:

- **QUICK_WINS_SUMMARY.md** - Phase 1 implementation: licensing, packaging, and basic documentation
- **PHASE2_SUMMARY.md** - Phase 2 implementation: CI/CD, GitHub Actions, and expanded documentation

- **[FAQ](../FAQ.md)** - Frequently asked questions
- **[OUTPUT_FORMAT](../OUTPUT_FORMAT.md)** - Detailed output column specifications
- **[DOWNLOAD_GUIDE](../DOWNLOAD_GUIDE.md)** - Guide for downloading GtRNAdb data

- **[CHANGELOG](../../CHANGELOG.md)** - Version history
- **[CONTRIBUTING](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)** - Contribution guidelines

## Why Archive?

These documents were valuable during development but created clutter in the main documentation. They've been moved here to:

1. **Preserve history** - Keep a record of the decision-making process
2. **Reduce clutter** - Make current documentation easier to find
3. **Maintain context** - Provide background for future development decisions

The work described in these documents has been completed and integrated into the project.
