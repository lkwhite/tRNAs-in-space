# üöÄüçÄ tRNAs in space üçÄüöÄ

*A standardized approach to generate shared tRNA coordinate space for plotting.*

This README documents how to go from adapter‚Äëtrimmed tRNA reference sequences ‚Üí R2DT drawings ‚Üí a single shared, equal‚Äëspaced coordinate axis for plotting and cross‚Äëisodecoder comparisons.

In this repository, you can also find pre-computed tables containing these indexed coordinates (`outputs/$SPECIES_global_coords.tsv`) for tRNAs from common model organisms as we build them. The documentation below and scripts in this repository can be further used to build such tables from scratch.

## The Problem

tRNA biologists have classically used the **Sprinzl positions** pictured above (named after M. Sprinzl, see *References*) instead of consecutive numbering within each isodecoder\[1\]. This system ensures that homologous structural features line up across different tRNAs. For instance, the anticodon is always assigned to positions 34-36 regardless of whether a particular tRNA sequence is longer or shorter.

This convention is biologically meaningful, but introduces problems for data integration:

1.  **Non-contiguous across isodecoders:** not every tRNA contains every Sprinzl position, so some positions are absent depending on sequence length or loop structure

2.  **Unequal spacing:** gaps in Sprinzl numbering create irregular axes, making it difficult to generate heatmaps or plots that assume equally spaced positions

3.  **Non-integer labels** like 17a, 20a, 20b and the e-notations in the variable loop further complicate use of Sprinzl as a common coordinate system

[R2DT 2.0](https://github.com/r2dt-bio/r2dt) partly addresses this by embedding Sprinzl numbering in its structural templates, allowing researchers to annotate secondary structure images using positional annotations relevant to tRNA biology. But for downstream analysis, a more unified coordinate system is needed.

## A Global Index

For tRNA sequencing (or other positionally anchored assays), it is often more useful to work in a **global coordinate system**:

-   Each nucleotide position is assigned a consecutive integer index (1,2,3...).

-   The index is consistent across all tRNAs, ensuring every position in a heatmap corresponds to an equal-spaced axis.

-   Missing Sprinzl positions can be interpolated or left blank without breaking the regular grid.

Here's an example from [our own work](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39091754/) where we attempted to align nuclear and mitochondrial tRNAs from budding yeast using Sprinzl coordinates. You'll note some positions appear as "missing" (gray), with the large grey region between Sprinzl positions 48 and 49 reflecting variable loop length, where none of the tRNAs displayed contains sequence covering the full set of variable loop positions. <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed9f8001-b2d8-44e2-a044-9c8017b0a89f" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-20 at 5 13 38‚ÄØPM" width="585" height="220"/>

However, there are still a few issues with the heatmap above.

-   The distribution of "missing" positions in the variable loop don't line up correctly with their Sprinzl annotations, because

-   the Sprinzl annotations along the X axis are actually only added during the plotting step, and

-   not all tRNAs are pictured, because these structural alignments were generated from a non-comprehensive `.afa` file downloaded from [Modomics](%5Burl%5D(https://genesilico.pl/modomics/rnafamilies/rf00005/))

By introducing a global index, we eliminate spacing irregularities and enable cross-isodecoder comparison in a clean, standardized coordinate space.

## Implementation

**Goal:** To convert heterogeneous Sprinzl-style labels from [R2DT](https://docs.r2dt.bio/en/latest/index.html) output into a unified coordinate system we need to:

-   Keep per‚Äënucleotide sequence order (5‚Ä≤‚Üí3‚Ä≤).

-   Preserve canonical Sprinzl labels (e.g., 20, 20A).

-   Fill unlabeled residues deterministically with fractional positions.

-   Generate a **global_index** (1..K) so all tRNAs plot on the same x‚Äëaxis; missing positions show as NA.

**Inputs** A FASTA file of mature tRNA sequences used for alignment/reference. For consistency, trim adapters out of these sequences if present.

**Outputs**:

-   A single TSV with per-base fields:

    -   `trna_id`,¬†`seq_index`,¬†`sprinzl_index`,¬†`sprinzl_label`,¬†`residue`

    -   `sprinzl_ordinal`,¬†`sprinzl_continuous`,¬†`global_index`,¬†`region`

## Prerequisites

-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com) (For [R2DT](https://github.com/r2dt-bio/r2dt))

-   Python 3.9+ with `pandas`.

-   Your tRNA reference fasta

-   `trnas_in_space.py` (from this repository): extracts per-nucleotide indices/labels from R2DT-produced¬†`.enriched.json`¬†files, fills Sprinzl gaps, builds global label order, assigns fractional/global indices, and annotates structural regions.

### Step 1: Run R2DT

From the directory containing your FASTA reference:

```         
docker run --rm \
-v "$(pwd):/data" \
rnacentral/r2dt \
r2dt.py gtrnadb draw /data/yourtRNAreference.fa /data/output
```

This runs R2DT in `gtrnadb draw` mode, using covariance models and tRNAscan-SE outputs to annotate tRNAs with structural information, generating `.json` files and secondary structure images for each tRNA in the reference.

### Step 2: Build global coordinates

We then extract information from all `*.enriched.json` files in `/output` using the script below and write them to a shared `tsv` for coordinate generation.

Run the single script on your R2DT output directory:

```         
python trnas_in_space.py ./output ecoliK12_global_coords.tsv
```

Note that this script overwrites the values of `sprinzl_index` with a best-effort fill based on neighboring positions, and assigns regions such as `anticodon-loop`, `acceptor-stem`, etc. Unresolvable cases retain `sprinzl_index` of `-1` and a `region` value of `unknown`.

-   Isodecoders: tRNAs that share the same anticodon

-   Isoacceptors: tRNAs charged by the same amino acid
